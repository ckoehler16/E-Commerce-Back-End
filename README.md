## Description

Due to the ever increasing popularity of e-commerce I created a back end application for an internet retail company that uses Sequelize and MySQL2 to configure with the Express.js API so it can connect to a MySQL database. With this application the user has access to the internet retail company's database to view, add, update, and delete it's retail categories, products, and tags.

## Installation

To install this application first clone the respository, [Repository Link](https://github.com/ckoehler16/E-Commerce-Back-End), onto your local machine. This application requires Node.js to run. Then you can install the necessary dependencies by entering into the root directory command line 'npm install express sequelize mysql2 dotenv'. Next you need to connect to MySQL by entering 'mysql -u root -p' into the root directory command line. Next enter your MySQL password if you have one and then follow up with entering 'source db/schema.sql'. Next go back to your root directory terminal and enter 'npm run seed' in the command line. After that you are ready to run the application by entering 'npm start' into the command line.

## Usage

In order to view and use the application you need to download Insomnia onto your local machine.
